I am creating a database for the company of Uber. 
In this database the main idea is that a “contractor” is assigned to work either at Uber or Uber eats. 
Uber is simply a ride givingcompany and Uber eats is a spinoff of Uber where they deliver food instead of giving rides.
In this scenario I will keep a log of every trip made by the contractor that is also connected by each customers. 
There’s also a score rating (out of 5) that will hopefully be implemented in the code as well. 
There’s multiple points of this database, one is to show the customer who the good drivers are. 
Second is to show the drivers who the good customers are. With so many people being bad driver (i.e. sexual assault happening) and so many riders being bad (i.e. puking and such) this would allow both parties to see the other and potentially decline the service from one another.
We also can have things like restaurant scores that the customer could look at as well as each induvial orders and rides that transpired. There could be a lot more implementations with the database however I did not want to go over the limit of 10 (I kept it to 9).
And then some of the things implemented could be used from Uber the company to see how much people spend more than a certain amount to maybe target those customers into keep using their services. Lyft (Ubers competitor) gives riders with good ratings a discount code and those who don’t use their services often as well.
Uber I don’t think has any of that in place which is why I think this might help them a lot with the business.

The website set for this project may no longer work as well as the server connection to the sql databse based on the fact that the person who made this project (James Kang) graduated from college and the domain for both the website and sql server was tied to the school (teacher wanted it that way)
